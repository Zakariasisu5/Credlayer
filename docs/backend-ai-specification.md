# CredLayer | Backend & AI Engineering Specification

**AI-powered wallet reputation and risk intelligence for Web3**

- **Document owner:** Zakaria — Founder & CEO, CredLayer
- **Status:** Draft for engineering review
- **Version:** 0.2
- **Last updated:** August 2026

## 1. Overview

CredLayer is a decentralized reputation protocol that analyzes on-chain wallet activity across multiple blockchains and produces AI-driven trust scores for wallets, users, organizations, and autonomous AI agents. This document defines the backend and AI engineering scope required to take CredLayer from prototype to a production-ready platform, and is intended as the shared reference for engineering, infrastructure, and API design decisions.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

The initial engineering effort should produce:

1. A production-ready backend service (FastAPI) backed by PostgreSQL and Redis
2. Supabase-based authentication and session management
3. A multi-chain wallet indexing pipeline covering Solana and EVM-compatible chains
4. An AI reputation engine that produces explainable, auditable trust scores
5. A developer platform: API keys, SDKs, usage analytics, and webhooks
6. An internal analytics and admin dashboard for monitoring score quality and platform health
7. A foundation for future Solana smart-contract integration (on-chain attestations, SBTs, staking, DAO governance)

## 3. Architecture

CredLayer follows a layered service architecture: a chain-indexing layer ingests raw wallet activity, a reputation/AI layer transforms that activity into scores and explanations, and an API/developer layer exposes the results to external consumers (developers, protocols, and AI agents).

### 3.1 High-level flow

1. **Indexing layer** — Helius (Solana) and QuickNode (EVM chains) stream wallet and transaction data into the platform
2. **Data layer** — PostgreSQL stores structured wallet, score, and organization data; Redis handles caching, rate limiting, and job queues
3. **Reputation engine** — LangChain/LangGraph orchestrates scoring pipelines; OpenAI API generates natural-language explanations of each score
4. **API layer** — FastAPI exposes authenticated REST endpoints consumed by the dashboard, SDKs, and third-party developers
5. **Auth layer** — Supabase Auth manages user, organization, and API-key identity

## 4. Core Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| API framework | FastAPI (Python) |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Cache / queue | Redis |
| Auth | Supabase Auth |
| ORM / migrations | SQLAlchemy, Alembic |
| Infrastructure | Docker |
| AI orchestration | LangChain / LangGraph |
| LLM provider | OpenAI API |
| Solana data | Helius |
| EVM data | QuickNode |
| Chains supported | Solana (primary), Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Sui |

## 5. Core Modules

### 5.1 Authentication
User, organization, and API-key authentication via Supabase Auth, including session management and role-based access control.

### 5.2 Wallets
Wallet registration, metadata storage, and activity history across supported chains.

### 5.3 Reputation Engine
Core scoring service — see Section 6 for detail.

### 5.4 AI Analysis
LLM-driven analysis layer that generates explainable summaries and flags anomalous or high-risk behavior patterns.

### 5.5 Developer Platform
Projects, API keys, SDKs, usage analytics, webhooks, and logs — see Section 7 for detail.

### 5.6 Organizations
Multi-user organization accounts with shared projects, billing, and role permissions.

### 5.7 AI Agents
A reputation model tailored to autonomous AI agent wallets, distinct from human-user wallets, supporting agent-to-agent trust verification.

### 5.8 Credentials
Verifiable reputation credentials/attestations that can be issued, shared, and independently verified.

### 5.9 Analytics
Aggregate platform and per-wallet analytics for internal monitoring and customer-facing dashboards.

### 5.10 Explorer
Public-facing wallet and score lookup interface.

### 5.11 Notifications
Event-driven alerts for score changes, risk flags, and account activity.

### 5.12 Admin Dashboard
Internal tooling for monitoring score quality, managing organizations/API keys, and reviewing flagged wallets.

## 6. Reputation Engine

The reputation engine is the core differentiator of CredLayer. For each wallet, organization, or agent, it produces:

1. A trust score on a 0–1000 scale
2. A categorical trust level (e.g., low / medium / high / verified)
3. A categorical risk level
4. A confidence score reflecting data completeness and model certainty
5. Wallet age and activity history
6. Protocol diversity (breadth of legitimate protocol interaction)
7. Governance participation score
8. AI-agent trust score (for agent-owned wallets)
9. Organization-level trust score (aggregated across member wallets)
10. A natural-language, explainable AI summary of how the score was derived

**Explainability is a hard requirement, not a nice-to-have:** every score must be traceable to the underlying signals that produced it, both for developer trust and for future on-chain attestation use cases.

## 7. Developer Platform

CredLayer exposes reputation data to external developers, protocols, and AI agents through:

1. **Projects** — logical grouping of API keys and usage under an organization
2. **API keys** — scoped, revocable credentials with per-key rate limits
3. **SDKs** — TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust client libraries
4. **Usage analytics** — per-key and per-project request volume, latency, and error rates
5. **Webhooks** — event delivery for score changes and risk flags
6. **Logs** — request/response logging for debugging and audit
7. **Rate limiting** — enforced at the API-gateway layer via Redis
8. **Billing-ready architecture** — usage metering designed to support future paid tiers

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

| Concern | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Scalability | Stateless API layer; horizontally scalable behind a load balancer |
| Latency | Cached score reads should target sub-200ms p95 response time |
| Reliability | Indexing pipeline must tolerate upstream (Helius/QuickNode) outages via retry/backoff and queuing |
| Security | Least-privilege API keys, encrypted secrets, audited admin access |
| Auditability | Every generated score must be reproducible and traceable to its input signals |
| Observability | Structured logging and metrics across indexing, scoring, and API layers |

## 9. Suggested Delivery Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation
1. Core API scaffolding (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Alembic)
2. Supabase Auth integration
3. Solana wallet indexing via Helius

### Phase 2 — Reputation Engine v1
1. Baseline scoring model (0–1000 scale) for Solana wallets
2. Explainable AI summaries via OpenAI API / LangChain
3. Admin dashboard for score review

### Phase 3 — Developer Platform
1. API keys, projects, and rate limiting
2. TypeScript and Python SDKs
3. Usage analytics and webhooks

### Phase 4 — Multi-chain & Agents
1. EVM chain indexing via QuickNode
2. AI agent wallet scoring model
3. Organization-level trust aggregation

### Phase 5 — On-chain & Credentials
1. Solana smart contracts for reputation attestations
2. Soulbound token (SBT) issuance
3. Staking and DAO governance integration

## 10. Future Work

The following are directionally planned but out of scope for the initial production build:

1. Solana smart contracts for on-chain reputation attestations
2. Soulbound tokens (SBTs) representing verified reputation credentials
3. Governance and staking mechanics tied to reputation
4. DAO integration for community-driven scoring parameters

## 11. Open Questions for the Team

1. What is the target accuracy/validation methodology for the initial scoring model, and against what ground truth?
2. What data retention policy applies to raw wallet activity vs. derived scores?
3. What is the fallback behavior when a wallet has insufficient history to produce a confident score?
4. Which chains beyond Solana are required for the first external-developer release?
